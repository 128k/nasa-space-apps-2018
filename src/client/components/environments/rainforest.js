        <p>Rainforests represent some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They are a huge carbon sink, with tonnes and tonnes of carbon locked up within the trunks, branches and leaves of the giant trees within them. The rainforests are often called the ‘lungs of the Earth’ for the vital role they play in gaseous exchange, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen. The rainforests also provide a range of other ‘ecosystem services’ which link into many other earth processes, from nutrient cycling and being part of the water cycle, to stabilising soil and climate.</p>

        <h2>Deforestation</h2>
        <p>Deforestation is affecting rainforests around the globe, with some of the worst affected areas in Indonesia and South America. Every hectare of rainforest that is destroyed reduces the habitats of endemic species from tigers, elephants and orangutans to reptiles and insects that share their homes, and the hundreds of plant species within the forests.</p>
        <p>Loss of rainforests can also affect the genetic diversity of the animals that remain. By causing habitat fragmentation, where previously linked expanses of rainforest are split as well as being reduced in size, animals cannot meet to reproduce adding further strain to their species.</p>
        <p>Destruction of the rainforests also releases the CO2 that is locked up in the forests, and could interfere with the ecosystem services that these habitats provide. This could include increased water runoff and nutrients being washed away impacting soil fertility and stability, and changes to climate due to changes in rainfall patterns and heat movement. Global temperatures could increase by 0.7 degrees C if all the trees in tropical regions were lost.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Deforestation</h2>
        <p>Deforestation has a number of causes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearing rainforest for palm oil plantations</li>
            <li>Rainforest clearing for grazing cattle and slash and burn clearance of rainforest to grow feed for cattle</li>
            <li>Removing forest to dig mines for minerals</li>
            <li>Logging (legal and illegal) for wood for furniture and fuel/paper production</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What could this mean?</h2>
        <p>Although these beautiful and diverse habitats have their own value and right to share our planet, loss of biodiversity has potential implications for humans too. Many new medicines and technologies can be developed based on plants and insects. Species loss around the world is happening at around 1000 times the natural background extinction rate (the expected natural rate of extinction calculated based on the fossil record). This could mean plants and animal species are lost before they are even discovered. </p>

        <h2>What can you do?</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Choose sustainably sourced palm oil</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>More than 15 million hectares of palm oil plantations exist around the globe with more than 6 million hectares in Indonesia - the biggest producer. Palm oil itself is not a bad crop - it is highly productive, giving 10 times the oil as soybean oil and it’s found in everything from biscuits to shampoo. The palm oil industry is also responsible for more than 4.5 million people's’ incomes, so boycotting it completely is not recommended by Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations such as the Sumatran Orangutan Society (SOS).</p>
                <p>Looking for palm oil certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) can help support sustainable and clean growing practices that do not destroy rainforests or peatlands and don’t exploit workers.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Reduce meat consumption</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Reducing the amount of meat (or type of meat) we eat can significantly reduce our carbon footprints but can also help tackle deforestation. Meat-based food production needs higher inputs of energy, water and land. Land is cleared to both raise cattle and grow soybeans which are used in animal feed. Soybeans are mostly grown in Brazil, Argentina and the USA, with the former two countries exporting 60% of their produce.</p>
                <p>Meat consumption has increased from 218 million tonnes in 1997-1999 and is projected to reach 376 million tonnes by 2030. As developing nations become more affluent, consumption of meat and dairy produce increases. Choosing lower carbon meat such as poultry, and reducing the overall amounts of dairy and meat produce in our diets would mean plants grown to feed animals could feed humans directly reducing strain on land.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Choose FSC wood and paper</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The value of tropical timber drives illegal logging, whilst paper products have been the subject of campaigns by environmental activist groups. The Forest Stewardship Council certifies forests to enable consumers to be sure the products they buy are managed sustainably.</p>
                <p>Buying recycled paper products also avoids the use of virgin pulp from ancient forests. Look out for recycled toilet paper next time you need to restock, and if you’re buying greetings cards or gift wrap, keep an eye out for recycled or FSC content.</p>
